# Where science meets software

As a Data Science graduate student at Pace University with roots in biotechnology and bioinformatics, I transitioned from decoding genomes in the lab to building machine learning pipelines in the cloud. 

Today, I focus on delivering real-world impact through predictive modeling, big data infrastructure, and scalable AI systems.

My portfolio blends statistical intuition with engineering precision â€” from NYC crime pattern detection to airline delay forecasting using Hive on AWS EMR. Iâ€™m not just experimenting with algorithms; Iâ€™m solving structured problems using data as a tool for clarity.
