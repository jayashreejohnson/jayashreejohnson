# Where Science meets Software

As a Data Science graduate student at Pace University with roots in biotechnology and bioinformatics, I transitioned from decoding genomes in the lab to building machine learning pipelines in the cloud. 

Today, I focus on delivering real-world impact through predictive modeling, big data infrastructure, and scalable AI systems.

My portfolio blends statistical intuition with engineering precision â€” from NYC crime pattern detection to airline delay forecasting using Hive on AWS EC2, EMR. Iâ€™m not just experimenting with algorithms, Iâ€™m solving structured problems using data as a tool for clarity.

## ðŸ“‚ Featured Projects  

ðŸ”¹ [Airline Delay Prediction â€“ Big Data + ML](https://github.com/jayashreejohnson/Airline-Delay-Prediction-BigData-ML)  
Launched Hive queries on AWS EMR to analyze 2003 DOT flight records, identifying delay-heavy carriers and airports. Trained SGD, KNN, and Decision Tree models with GridSearchCV, delivering scalable delay prediction modeling.

ðŸ”¹ [NYC Electricity Forecasting (Prophet)](https://github.com/jayashreejohnson/NYC-Electricity-Forecasting)  
Forecasted NYC energy demand using Facebook Prophet across multiple resolutions and growth curves. Delivered strategic insights for infrastructure planning with 10+ year horizon modeling.

ðŸ”¹ [NYC Traffic Classification & Regression](https://github.com/jayashreejohnson/NYC-Traffic-ML-Modeling)  
Analyzed NYC Open Data traffic counts to predict volume and classify congestion levels using Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SGD. Achieved near-perfect accuracy in regression (RÂ² â‰ˆ 1.00) and applied GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.


ðŸ”¹ [Web Scraper: 419 Scam Email Archive](https://github.com/jayashreejohnson/Scam-Email-Web-Scraper)  
Built an automated scraper to extract timestamped scam email listings from 419scam.org using BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Regex. Produced a structured dataset for future use in fraud detection or NLP modeling.

ðŸ”¹ [Diabetes Dataset Regression Analysis](https://github.com/jayashreejohnson/Diabetes-EDA--Regression)  
Explored clinical data from the Stanford Diabetes dataset using EDA and built interpretable linear models to assess predictors of disease progression. Identified BMI as the most impactful feature (MSE = 3890.46).

ðŸ”¹ [SQL UDF Logic & Statistics](https://github.com/jayashreejohnson/SQL-UDF-Logic-and-Stats)  
Built modular SQL user-defined functions to automate logic-based messages, average calculations, and variance computation using `IF`, `WHILE`, and nested function calls in MySQL.
